   \item 
\end{itemize}

\section*{Why is it important?}
\begin{itemize}
   \item Healthcare in developed countries is under the biggest 5 industry sectors
   \item Helathcare in developed countries counts for about 10 \% of Gross Domestic Product (BIP)
   \item costs are growing $\rightarrow$ grow rate is higher than GDP growth
   \item In Switzerland we pay 12.2 \% of all the money (GDP) for healthcare
   \item The Age structure is changing $\rightarrow$ Higher life expectancy (we get older than 80)
   \item We die after long period with chronic diseaes and this has changed compared to years ago - this is the bad news about living longer
   \item The costs of healthcare has increased dramatically $\rightarrow$ Ausgaben wurden seit 1969 verdopplet von 6 auf 12 Prozent
   \item 
\end{itemize}

\section{General Practitioner (Hausarzt)}
   \subsection{a day in a life}
   \begin{itemize}
      \item Family doctor or physician
      \item typically works in private or group practice
      \item provides diagnosis and care for patients in routine cases $\rightarrow$ ambulant care
      \item usually refers people to specialists when they need specific types of treatment
      \item has receptionsst and physician assistant
   \end{itemize}

   \subsection{typical workflow}
   \begin{enumerate}
      \item Pre-visit: Appointment scheduling and information collection
      \item Check-in: patient check-in and payment collection/Health insurance registration
      \item Control: rooming, measuring vital signs, patient examination, prescription and result documentation $\rightarrow$ optional there are some extra lab-tasks e.g. blood test 
      \item Check-out: patient checkout
      \item Post-visit: coding and billing / Reviewing Test results
   \end{enumerate}

   \subsection{Clincal Tools}
   Paper- or IT-based, whether what is used, there are medical records used
   \begin{itemize}
      \item Screening for illness and disease $\rightarrow$ identify at-risk patents
   \end{itemize} 

   \subsection{Medication Management}
   \begin{itemize}
      \item Medication errors are the most frequent source of preventable medical errors
      \item Medication Administration Record 
      \item Electronic Medication Administration records
      \item Adverse Drug Event $\rightarrow$ side effect or complication

      \item Medication reconcilation $\rightarrow$ comparing patients list of medications at admission with medications ordered during hospital stay
      \item order sets $\rightarrow$ standardized list of orders for a specific diagnosis e.g. heart disease
   \end{itemize}

      \subsubsection{What could go wrong?}
   \begin{itemize}
      \item Drug-Allergy Conflic
      \item Drug-Disaese Conflict
      \item Incorrect Dosage
      \item Incorrect Duration
      \item Drug-Pregnancy Conflict
      \item Drug-Age Conflict
      \item Drug-Gender Conflict
      \item Drug-Drug Conflict
   \end{itemize}
   $\rightarrow$ This could be checked by a electronic drug databases to reduce the errors

   \subsection{Coding and reimbursement}
   \begin{itemize}
      \item Documentation and coding plays a major role in whether a payer (health insurance) approves claims and reimburse the physician
      \item Computer-assisted coding uses software to faciliate claim processiong
      \item typically country-specific $\rightarrow$ in Switzerland TARMED (Tarif MÃ©dicaux)
   \end{itemize}
   
      \subsubsection{TARMED}
      \textbf{Overview:}
      \begin{itemize}
         \item TARMES is the swiss standard tarif for medical and paramedical services provided in medical practices and hospitals
         \item since 2004 in every canton
         \item TARMED tariff comprises about 4600 positions
         \item Pricing of medical services is calculated consistently throughout Switzerland with so-called tax positions
         \item However, the amount of remunerations per tax point varies from canton to canton
         \item These codes from TARMED we will find on our bills from the doctor, 
      \end{itemize}

\section{Current situation / status of healthcare industry}
\begin{itemize}
   \item Physician: still heavily paper-based $\rightarrow$ to record, store and communicate in hand-written as well as with fax
   \item Hospitals: core ICT in use $\rightarrow$ nevertheless there is space for improvement
\end{itemize}

   \subsection{Why does healthcare lack in ICT}
\begin{itemize}
   \item complexity of care / of healthcare ecosystem $\rightarrow$ many stakeholders, large number of small org
   \item Incentives are misaligned $\rightarrow$ Goals are different; higher quality may not result in more customers
   \item Data entry effort vs. personal benefit
   \item Network externality / missing network effects
\end{itemize}

\section{Telehealth}
Telehealth includes the use of technology to access remote health information, diagnostic imgaes and education
\begin{itemize}
   \item Email communication
   \item Refilling prescriptions
   \item Registering patient
   \item Scheduling appointments
\end{itemize}

\section{Telemedicine}
The use of medical information exchanged from one site to another via electronic communications

       \end{Figure}

\section{Information systems in healthcare organizations}

\subsection{Complexity of ICT at hospital}
\begin{itemize}
   \item Practitioners' offices typically maintain one Clinical information system
   \item have numerous clinical information systems (Laboratory, pharmacy, radiology systems etc.)
   \item Need for interoperability and integration
\end{itemize}
$\Rightarrow$ A HIS is really complex not only in the functions but also in the GUI
\begin{Figure}
   \centering
    \includegraphics[width=150px]{img/HIS.png}
        \captionof{figure}{Healthcare information and management systems}
        \label{fig:HIS}
\end{Figure}

\subsection{Main Functions from a HIS}
There are two types
\begin{itemize}
   \item clincal support
   \item Administrative support
\end{itemize}

We need all information and have directly access to the information, to get a better documentation and improve the quality of care.\\ 
Especially to reduce to errors in daily business and improve the productivity and efficiency.


\subsubsection{Clincal Support}
\textbf{Nursing}\\
Support the daily business of a nurse e.g. view and update vital data, access to drug info\\
\textit{Goal:} Documentation access to info, productivity and communications, regulatory compliance\\

\textbf{Monitoring}\\
monitor the patients and alert immediately if there is an abnormal finding e.g. real-time monitoring, automatically feeding into the CIS\\

\textbf{Order Entry}\\
Direct entry of orders for medication and transmit orders online (e.g. pharmacy, Laboratory, radiology, social services, ...)\\

\textbf{Laboratory}\\
so-called \textit{Laboratory Mangement System} to provide
\begin{itemize}
   \item Manage lab test
   \item alert if a test results is critical
   \item Send results to CIS
   \item Accept inputs from bedside devices
   \item Use rules to order additional tests
   \item Address issues such as turn-around time, duplicates, errors
\end{itemize}
\textit{LOINC Standard} Logical Observation Identifiers Namens and codes\\

\textbf{Radiology}\\
Should provide the functions to support the daily business such as
\begin{itemize}
   \item allow direct order
   \item Scheduling diagonstic test
   \item generate client instructions
   \item permit transcription of results
   \item provide picture archiving
   \item generate charges once procedures are done
\end{itemize}
\textit{Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS)}: Images from X-Ray/CT/MRI devices transferred PACS which is linked directly to the CIS. And provide directly access to results and searching\\

\textbf{Pharmacy} (eMedication / ePrescription)\\
\begin{itemize}
   \item provide checks in order
   \item administration process using evidence-based guidelines
   \item Barcode and RFID Medication administration
   \item Dispensing systems
   \item Use lab results, allergy and interaction information from CIS
   \item track medication use, costs and billing information
\end{itemize}
\textit{Electronic Medication Administration Records (eMAR)} the main goal is to eliminate errors.

\subsubsection{Administrative Information Systems}
It is a very often scenario that a hospital runs two different system, one for the CIS and one for the Admin-part
\textbf{Patient and Client Registration}\\
\begin{itemize}
   \item admission, discharged and Transfer (ADT) systems
   \item Collect and sotre demographic and insurance data
   \item critical to opersionts to ensure correct patient identification
   \item One of the most important part is how to identify the patient (Barcode etc.)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Financial Systems}\\
\begin{itemize}
   \item Charge all services
   \item provide data for insurance
   \item financial controlling
   \item generate reports
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Payroll and Human Resources}\\
\begin{itemize}
   \item Payroll
   \item Contracting
   \item Career planing
   \item Physical access control (key, badge etc)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Risk Management}\\
\begin{itemize}
   \item risk monitoring
   \item reduce risk
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Quality Assurance}\\
\begin{itemize}
   \item Management Cockpit
   \item Decision Support Systems
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Contract Management}\\
\begin{itemize}
   \item provide visibility and control to negotiate better contract with vendors etc.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Scheduling Systems}\\
\begin{itemize}
   \item Planning appointments
   \item Staff Planning
   \item insurance approval
   \item charging information
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Other Admin Systems}\\
\begin{itemize}
   \item IT Security Management
   \item Facility Management
   \item Roles and Access Rights Mgmt
\end{itemize}

$\Rightarrow$ The IT-Security Part is one of the most important and fragile parts in a hospital. If a hospital gets hacked, there are a lot of consequences and it can decide between life and death.

\chapter{Health Data - Standards and Ontologies}

\section{HIS related}

\subsection{Challenges}
\begin{itemize}
   \item Hospital is a huge organisation $\rightarrow$ many departments, people, stakleholders and activities
   \item demand for good information $\rightarrow$ the right content in the right time at the right time to a specific user
   \item distribution of data and knowlege $\rightarrow$ many different sources, location and systems create a lot of data (structured and unstructured)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Usability Issues}
\begin{itemize}
   \item Interference with patient visit
   \item Lack of system-design support for team-based care
   \item care coordination due to lack of data interoperability
   \item increased cognitive workload for physicians
   \item lack of product modularity to support unique needs
   \item lock-in to systems
   \item communicating with patients in a changing digital landscape
   \item insufficient support for enduser
\end{itemize}


\section{Types of data}
\textbf{Clinical Data}
\begin{itemize}
   \item clinical or health-related information used by providers in diagnosing, treating and monitoring
   \item case-based: illness, accident
   \item life-cycle-oriented: medical health record
\end{itemize}

\textbf{administrative Data}
\begin{itemize}
   \item primary purposes on the administrative data side is billing
   \item dealing with diagnosis codes and procedure codes $\rightarrow$ TARMED or SwissDRG
\end{itemize}

\section{Entering Data into a HIS}
There a various ways to enter the data into a HIS. The data will be enter by a desktop computer (after consultation or discharge) or mobile device (bed-side)
\begin{itemize}
   \item manual typing
   \item clinical templates
   \item dictation and transcription
   \item voice recognition
   \item scanning and OCR
   \item touchscreen
\end{itemize}

\section{Metadata}
data about data - there are different levels of metadata and therefore different Complexity
\begin{itemize}
   \item Schema $\rightarrow$ Definition of data format (e.g. XML Schema)
   \item Vocabulary $\rightarrow$ allowed values, code translation
   \item Classifcation $\rightarrow$ topic-oriented type hierachy
   \item Taxonomy $\rightarrow$ controlled vocabulary with structured directory of terms
   \item Thesaurus $\rightarrow$  map words to concept
   \item Ontology $\rightarrow$ Model of a domain with rules and it is a knowledge representation which is machine-readable 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Semantic gap}
Since words has different meaning in a specific context sometimes it is not clear what is meant. Therefore it's a \textbf{semantic gap} between words and concept\\
e.g.: Double Bass = Upright Bass = Contrabass (synonym) or  fruit $\leftarrow$ Apple $\rightarrow$ Company\\
$\Rightarrow$ Thesauri and onotlogies manage semantic

\subsection{Categorization}
Generalization vs. Specialization $\rightarrow$ we typically learn basic level (e.g. Chair, Table) categories first\\
\begin{itemize}
   \item we get more precise with subcategories $\rightarrow$ Hyponym (Unterbegriffe) and subordinate (untergeordnet) e.g. dining chair, kitchen table
   \item we get more abstract with supercategories $\rightarrow$ hypernyms (Oberbegriff) and superordinate (Ã¼bergeordnet) e.g. furniture
\end{itemize}

\subsection{IHE Integrations Profiles (Extract)}
\begin{itemize}
   \item Audit Trail and Node Authentication (ATNA)
   \item Consistent Time (CT)
   \item Cross-Community Access (XCA)
   \item Cross-Community Patient Discovery (XCPD)
   \item Cross
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Consistent Time (CT)}
It is a timeserver, which provides a base-time. This is very important to make sure every transaction is based on the same time, especially to log all the different transaction (protocol) 
\begin{Figure}

\end{Figure}

\subsubsection{Patient Identifier Cross-Referencing}
The PIXV3 Profile supports the cross-referencing of patient identifiers from multiple Patient Identifier Domains. These cross-referenced patient identifiers can then be used by 'identity consumer' systems to correlate information
about a single patient from sources that 'know' the patient by different identifiers. This allows a clinican to have more complete view of the patient information\\

\textbf{Important:} Within an EHR it is not allowed to use the 'social security number' (AHV-Nummer). Furthermore there is no national-identify-method for patient. Every hospital has its own ID-System for the patients

\subsection{Clincial Decision Making}
\begin{itemize}
   \item medical decision making required the clinician to apply accumulated knowledge to a specific amount of patient information to produce a result that may be a diagnosis, prognosis, cooruse of therapy or the selection of further tests
   \item $\Rightarrow$ Too often: the decisions are based on limited knowledge, the information is incomplete or imperfect and the decision must be made during a limited period of time
\end{itemize}

   \subitem to ask collegues
   \subitem do research in the internet
   \subitem use medical guidelines
   \subitem use medical handbooks
   \subitem search in bilbiographic retrieval systems (e.g. PubMed)

\begin{itemize}
   \item Study diseases across species
   \subitem e.g. using model organisms (mice) to understand / predict evolution of disease in humans 
   \item Repurpose drugs
   \subitem Prioritise existing drugs for new diseases $\leftrightarrow$ reducing time and cost for devel 
   \item Understand gene function 
   \subitem E.G. what genes have a role in respiration?
   \subitem What genes are associated with possible cancer types? 
\end{itemize}

It is very important to build precise queries. For example the term 'rich' can be interpreted differently. e.g. Bill Gates has another understanding in rich, so it won't be a good idea to set the question 'which employees are rich?'


\chapter{mobile Health}
eHealth + mobile = mobile health = mHealth

$\rightarrow$ Healthcare is everywhere

\begin{itemize}
   \item smartphone is part of our life
   \subitem Smartphones are always on, computers are not 
   \item eHealth at any point of care
   \subitem at home / work / bedside etc. 
   \item telemedicine services
   \subitem Remote health serices in rural regions
   \subitem health services for developing countries 
   \item Patient engagement
   \subitem increased self-management of well-being and illness
   \subitem reduced number of hospital stays 
\end{itemize}

        \label{fig:Patient Engangement using Apps}
\end{Figure}

\subsection{Types of mHealth Apps}
\begin{itemize}
   \item Clinical assistance apps
   \item Reference / database apps (eg.UpToDate)
   \item General facility information / communication apps
   \item Monitoring apps (telemedicine)
   \item Reminder apps (e.g., medication)
   \item healthy life apps (fitness, nutrition, diets, mood)
   \item patient portal / EHR apps
   \item speciality / disease-specific apps (pregnancy, kids, diabetes)
\end{itemize}

$\Rightarrow$ most apps re for patients / consumers, not for healthcare professionals

\section{mHealth today}
\begin{itemize}
   \item Large number of lifestyle, fitness and well-being apps
   \subitem no clear evidence on their quality and reliability 
   \item Role of mHealth in healthcare systems unclear
   \subitem Personal vs. clinical mHealth apps, business models 
   \item Issues on privacy and security
   \subitem a lot of free Apps
   \subitem Regulations and laws are not (yet) established 
   \item Standards, protocols and guidelines are evolving
   \subitem importance of sharing and transfering best practices 
   \subitem need for certification schemes / quality labelling 
\end{itemize}

        \label{fig:eHealth and mHealth Challenges today}
\end{Figure}

\subsection{eHealth App Regulation}
\begin{itemize}
   \item International regulations
   \subitem US: FDA, Health Insurance Portability and ACcountability Act (HIPAA) Security Rule

   \subitem Heilmittelgesetzt (HMG), Medizinprodukteverordnung (MepV) $\rightarrow$ Anlehnung an EU-Richtlinien
   \item Guidelines
   \subitem App Store Review Guidelines
   \item Recommendations  
\end{itemize}

$\Rightarrow$ \textit{Is an eHealth App a Medical Device?}\\
\textbf{EU MEDDEV regulations}
\begin{itemize}
   \item Hospital Information Systems are not qualified as medical devices. However they may be used with additional modules which might be qualified in their own right as medical devices
   \item EHR systems that simply replaces a patient's paper file does not meet the definition of a medical device. But certain modules can be a medical device
   \item Modules that contribute to diagnosis, therapy and follow-up (e.g. generate alarms) are qualified as medical devices
   \item Decision Support Software are qualified as medical devices
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Apple App Store Guidelines}
$\Rightarrow$ Strict rules for health and wellness apps
\begin{itemize}
   \item privacy protection
   \item avoid physical harm
   \subitem Inaccurate data that could potentially cause physical harm
   \subitem Apps related to forbidden drugs
   \subitem Apps with harmful recommendations
   \item Drug dosage calculators must come from the drug manufacturer, a hospital, university, health insurance company, or other approved entity, or receive approval by the FDA or one of its international counterparts
\end{itemize}

\textit{What does this mean?}
\begin{itemize}
   \item Laws and reulgations are currently work in progress
   \item If a software is a medical product / medical device
   \subitem I) A CE certification is need
   \subitem II) The software company has to run a documented software quality management process (eg. ISO 13485)
